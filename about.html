        I study Computer Science and spend most of my time learning how systems work and how to make them better.
        When I am not studying, I build small tools, experiment with web design, and read.
        I enjoy teaching and mentoring, whether that means helping friends debug code or explaining algorithms in simple terms.

      <h2 class="eyebrow">In more than a few words</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        I was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and spent part of my childhood there before moving several times.
        My family lived in Dubai for a few years, then settled in Calgary.
        Frequent change taught me how to adapt quickly and find comfort in starting over.
        That is likely why I enjoy building things from scratch and understanding how they work beneath the surface.

      <p class="copy">
        I have always been curious about structure and design.
        I like seeing how lines of code form patterns and how those patterns grow into systems.
        That curiosity led me to software: writing programs, testing ideas, and refining them until they work the way they should.

        My academic interests revolve around systems and data.
        I am drawn to how things connect, scale, and communicate.
        I am also interested in engineering design and product strategy, especially when technology simplifies everyday work.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        Outside of academics, I read both fiction and non-fiction, keep short notes, and explore topics in design and history.
        I admire people who create quietly and value consistency more than attention.
