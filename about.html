      <h2>In so few words</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        I study Computer Science and enjoy learning how systems work and how thoughtful design improves them.
        Outside of classes I build small tools, read, and write about ideas that connect technology and people.

        I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi" target="_blank">Karachi</a>,
        spent part of my childhood in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai" target="_blank">Dubai</a>,
        and later moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary" target="_blank">Calgary</a>.
        Moving often taught me to adapt easily and find comfort in change.

        I’m curious about systems, design, and how small details shape structure.
        I like how lines of code can grow into patterns and patterns into systems.
        That curiosity led me to programming, testing, and refining until things feel right.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        When I’m not coding, I read, learn about art and design, and think about how people build meaningful things.
