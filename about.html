      <h2>In so few words</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        I study Computer Science and enjoy learning how systems work and how thoughtful design can improve them.
        Outside of classes I build small tools, read, and write about ideas that connect technology and people.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore" target="_blank">Lahore</a>,
        spent part of my childhood in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ain" target="_blank">Al Ain</a>,
        and later moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary" target="_blank">Calgary</a>.
        Moving often taught me to adapt easily and find comfort in change.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        I am curious about systems, design, and the small details that shape structure.
        I like seeing how lines of code form patterns and how those patterns evolve into systems.
        That curiosity led me to programming, testing, and refining until things feel right.
      </p>

      <h2>Somewhere beyond</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        Outside of computing, I have always been drawn to space. I find a sense of calm and awe in learning about the universe.
        I often read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank">general relativity</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="_blank">special relativity</a>, and how these ideas shape our understanding of time, light, and gravity.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        I am especially interested in black holes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*" target="_blank">Sagittarius A*</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87*" target="_blank">Messier 87*</a>,
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1" target="_blank">Cygnus X-1</a>.
        They represent some of nature’s most fascinating contradictions, where simplicity and complexity meet in perfect balance.
      </p>
      <p class="copy">
        On clear nights, I like looking up at the stars. It reminds me how small we are compared to everything else, and how lucky we are to even be able to look at it.
      </p>

      <p class="copy">
        When I am not coding or reading about the universe, I spend time learning about art, design, and the ways people create meaningful work.
